# Mental Health Support System

A microservices-based backend platform built with **Spring Boot** and **Java 17** to support mental health services such as counselor discovery, appointment booking, session communication, and self-help resources.  
The project follows a **base service template approach** to ensure consistent structure, dependencies, and error handling across all services.
